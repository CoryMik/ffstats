You are given three JSON files from Sleeper fantasy football:

1. teams_league2.json — contains user_id, display_name, metadata (team_name, avatar, etc.)
2. draft_league2.json — contains overall draft info (rounds, slots, etc.)
3. draft_picks_league2.json — contains each pick, player metadata, picked_by user_id, and reactions (with emoji counts).

Task: Combine these into a single JSON file called league_data.json with the following structure:

{
  "league_name": "<League Name from draft.json or manual input>",
  "season": <season year>,
  "scoring_type": "<ppr/half/standard>",
  "superlatives": {
    "most_poops": [<top 3 user_ids ranked by poop_count>],
    "best_team_name": [<user_ids you judge to have the most creative names>],
    "best_draft": {
        "team_id":<user_id judged best draft value>
        "info" : "<quick few words to summarize why its the best draft>"
        },
    "shakiest_draft":
    {
         "team_id":<user_id judged weakest draft>
         "info" : "<quick few words to summarize why its the worst draft>"]
    },

  },
  "teams": [
    {
      "user_id": "<user_id>",
      "display_name": "<display_name>",
      "team_name": "<team_name or fallback to display_name>",
      "avatar_url": "<full Sleeper avatar URL or default>",
      "grade": "<Letter Grade you assign based on draft>",
      "creativity_score": <1–10 rating of team name creativity>,
      "blurb_good": "<Short blurb of what went well in draft>",
      "blurb_bad": "<Short blurb of weaknesses or risks>",
      "poop_count": <total poop emojis from reactions in draft_picks.json>,
      "poop_events": [
        {
          "player": "<player drafted>",
          "round": <round number>,
          "poops": <number of poop reactions>
        }
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Steps:
1. Parse teams.json to map each user_id → display_name, team_name, avatar (build avatar_url using https://sleepercdn.com/avatars/{hash} if not a full URL).
2. Parse draft_picks.json to assign each pick to the correct team (via picked_by). Count the "poop" emoji reactions per player and total them per team. Store details of each poop event.
3. Use draft.json for season/year and league_name if available.
4. For each team, write a one-sentence **blurb_good** and **blurb_bad** analyzing their draft (based on roster construction, positional balance, risks, or notable players). Assign a grade (A, B+, B, C, etc.).
5. Rate **creativity_score** (1–10) based on the cleverness of their team_name in teams.json.
6. In "superlatives", fill in:
   - "most_poops" = top 3 user_ids by poop_count
   - "best_team_name" = most creative names (subjective)
   - "best_draft" = team that got the best values (subjective)
   - "shakiest_draft" = team with most risky/poor balance (subjective)

Output: Return only valid JSON following the structure above.
